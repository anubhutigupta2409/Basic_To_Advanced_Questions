/*
Product of Array Except Self

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 105
-30 <= nums[i] <= 30
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
 

Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

/*
Approach-->
Given numbers [2, 3, 4, 5], regarding the third number 4, the product of array except 4 is 2*3*5 which consists of two parts: left 2*3 and right 5. The product is left*right. We can get lefts and rights:

Numbers:     2    3    4     5
Lefts:            2  2*3 2*3*4
Rights:  3*4*5  4*5    5      
Letâ€™s fill the empty with 1:

Numbers:     2    3    4     5
Lefts:       1    2  2*3 2*3*4
Rights:  3*4*5  4*5    5     1
We can calculate lefts and rights in 2 loops. The time complexity is O(n).

We store lefts in result array. If we allocate a new array for rights. The space complexity is O(n). To make it O(1), we just need to store it in a variable which is right

class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {

        int left=1, right=1;//storing lefts and rights
        int n= nums.length;
        int res[] = new int[n];

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            if(i>0)
                left*=nums[i-1];
            res[i] = left;
        }
        for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--)
        {
            if(i<n-1)
                right*=nums[i+1];
            res[i]*=right;
        }

        return res;
    }
}
